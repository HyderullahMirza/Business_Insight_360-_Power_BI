### Company Background

AtliQ Hardware, a global computer and accessories retailer, expanded its business channels worldwide, driving substantial growth.

### Solution Implementation

•	Understanding Expectations: Align project goals with stakeholder expectations and set deadlines.
•	Mockup and Approval: Create mockups, gain client approval, and incorporate feedback.
•	Benchmark Numbers: Acquire benchmark data for result verification.
•	Data Collection and Cleaning: Gather and clean relevant data for analysis.
•	Data Transformation: Utilize Power Query for data manipulation, creating fact and dimension tables.
•	Data Modeling: Implement Snowflake schema, connecting fact and dimension tables.
•	Dashboard Design: Develop dashboards based on approved mockups, incorporating calculated measures.

### Homepage:

•	Designed an intuitive Power BI homepage with clickable icons for various reports/views.
•	Integrated hyperlinks, enabling users to navigate directly to specific reports by clicking on the respective icons.
•	Implemented a dynamic measure using DAX to display the last refresh date of the report prominently on the homepage.
•	Created a footer section containing essential information, clarifying that all monetary values are presented in millions and dollars.
•	Developed a DAX measure to identify the most recent date within the available sales data.
•	Displayed the latest sales date prominently on the homepage, enhancing the data's relevance and context for users.

### Finance View

•	Metrics and Reports: Develop P&L statements, charts, slicers, and KPI indicators for finance team monitoring.
•	Dynamic Filtering: Enable dynamic filtering between current sales data and previous year/target data.
•	Region and Segment Analysis: Provide region-wise and segment-wise P&L statements with percentage change insights.
 

### Sales View

•	Customer-Centric Reports: Generate customer-wise net sales, gross margin, and percentage insights.
•	Performance Metrics: Develop performance matrices for region-wise customer analysis.
•	Product Performance: Create detailed reports for product sales and margins.
 

### Supply Chain View

•	KPI Analysis: Implement KPIs for forecast accuracy, net error, and absolute net error.
•	Trend Analysis: Visualize trend data with line/bar charts for accuracy and error metrics.
•	Customer and Segment Reports: Deliver detailed reports on forecast accuracy and error metrics for different customer segments. 

### Optimizing Dashboard:

•	Data Cleansing: Cleanse and transform data during the loading process to reduce processing time and improve report performance.
•	Unload table in power query to improve performance.
•	Reduce decimal numbers up to 2 digits
•	Use Slicers and Drill-Downs: Implement slicers and drill-downs for users to interact with data, reducing the need for multiple visuals.
•	Limit Visualizations: Limit the number of visuals on a single page. Overloading a page with visuals can lead to slower rendering.
•	Performance Analyzer: Utilize the built-in Performance Analyzer to identify slow-loading visuals and queries.
•	Query Diagnostics: Analyze query performance using Query Diagnostics in the Power BI Desktop.
•	Stay Updated: Keep Power BI Desktop, the gateway, and data sources up-to-date to leverage the latest optimizations and enhancements.
•	Incremental Refresh: Implement incremental refresh to only refresh new or modified data, reducing data load time.
•	Scheduled Refresh: Schedule data refresh during off-peak hours to avoid server congestion.

By following this structured approach, AtliQ Hardware has gained comprehensive insights into their business operations, paving the way for informed and strategic decision-making.
